This code attempts to access an array element using a non-integer key.  In PHP, array keys are typically integers, although strings can also be used.  However, if you attempt to access an array element using a key that doesn't exist, you'll get an error, usually a warning, rather than a simple null value.

```php
<?php
$myArray = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry'];

// Incorrect attempt to access element
$value = $myArray['a']; // This will generate a warning

echo $value; //outputs nothing
?>
```
